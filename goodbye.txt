i really don't have much time to talk about this because i'm taking my own life, i really been living through hell through my entire life, i thought life would get better but it just keeps 
getting worse, i'm sorry to everyone i hurt. 
I never thought i would really be killing myself, i'm sorry to everyone i made fun of, hurt, & disappointed. 
I love every single one of you that has been supporting me on this journey. Gigi i'm sorry, please get better. 
If i'm not on at all tonight 6/18 i took my own life. I don't deserve to breathe & I don't even deserve to have any friends. 
i love every single one of you for trying to help me, but its too late, i'm about to kill my self after i send this, 
theres no messaging my friends because no one can help me like sky did, 
hes gone, my moms gone, all my loved ones have fallen, 
and now its my time to fall where ever go takes me, i promised many i'd never kill my self but sometimes promises are meant to be broken, 
every day and night i'm afraid what my future is gonna be, i'm sorry to everyone, i really am, everyone will get over this within a day anyways
I'm going to be up there with my Mom. 
~ From Kyle, Rico, Akayai, & Justin. Love you ❤️
